# Data exploration

There are some important ways that are helpful in understanding and visualizing data. Once the data is read, and there is a dataframe object created you can:

    - preview dataframe

        dataframe.head(n_rows)
        First n_rows of a dataframe as a table

        dataframe.info()
        Information about the dataframe

        dataframe.describe()
        Description of the data and some summary statistics (count, mean, max, min, etc)

There are many other methods that display data in various ways. Please refer to the documentation link below
